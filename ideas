In all of the ideas below, P is a predicate on words

Stage: word-cloud with each word occupying 1-3 grid cells
  - Some words might be nonsensical
  - Different regions may have a predicate P that most words in them adhere to
  - Understanding these patterns help the player search for words more easily
Player/enemies: move on words? move on negative space? (Probably the latter)
Not all words are visible to a player at one time
  - If sprites move in negative space, run normal visibility algorithm
  - Otherwise, player can see X-radius away
Quests:
  - The player must complete quests to progress
  - "Find a word meaning ____"
  - "Find X words satisfying P"
Operations:
  - Polymorph: anagram a word (to another word, if possible?)
  - Marker: prepend/append letters to a word
  - Eraser: remove letters from either end of a word
  - Rhyme: turn a word into a rhyming word
"Weapons" for mining (if sprites move in negative space):
  - Knife: destroys a single word
  - Sword: destroys a single word, faster
  - Torch: starts a fire, burns nearby words too
Static effects:
  - Boots of P-walking: moving on P words takes no time
    - How would this item work in the negative-space version?
  - Scroll of identify: Defines a word
  - Scroll of detect-P: Shows the player the location of P-words
    - Similarly, scroll of find-word and scroll of find-regex
    - Maybe these are blessed/cursed versions of the same scroll?
  - Ring of clairvoyance: see further into the stack
    - Probably want to build up clairvoyance further and further
  - Ring of P-warning: warns the player of the location of P-words
Interactions with enemies:
  - Enemies could attack player's health or destroy their resources
  - More unpredictable, but also potentially more interesting:
    - Could anagram words near them, or do other operations
    - Could destroy/mine words near them
    - Could be feed on P-words and be able to sense them
    - Could be protective of P-words
  - Might be able to pacify an enemy by using a word
