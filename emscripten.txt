1. Download the freetype source code.
2. Enter the freetype directiory, then run:
    EMSCRIPTEN_JS=1 emconfigure ./configure
    emmake make
3. After this step is done, in the objs directory you should see a number of
   .o and .a files. Open up one of these and verify that it starts with "BC" -
   that is, that it is bytecode.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for any other libraries you need.
5. Copy all .o and .a files from all libraries into your project.
6. Edit your Makefile so that when linking your project, all these bytecode
   files are linked as well.
